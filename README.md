The Myntra Apparel Data Analysis project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and retrieving e-commerce product data to generate actionable insights. Using Excel, the dataset underwent thorough preprocessing, including standardizing the ‘DiscountOffer’ column, removing duplicates, and handling null values. Additional computed fields and conditional formulas were used to segment products based on discount levels, identify average prices for highly rated products, and count items meeting specific criteria, such as size availability and discount thresholds.

For data retrieval, advanced lookup functions such as VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH were applied to extract detailed product information including brand, price, and rating, as well as calculate discount prices for specific items. The project demonstrates strong skills in data preparation, formula-based analytics, and efficient information retrieval, enabling faster decision-making and improved data accuracy. This end-to-end approach ensures clean, structured, and insight-rich datasets that can support business strategies, marketing campaigns, and product optimization for online retail platforms.
